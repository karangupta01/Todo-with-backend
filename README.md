**Basic MERN Stack To-Do App**
This is a very simple to-do application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js). 
The primary goal of this project is to help beginners understand how the frontend connects with the backend and how data flows between them.
It demonstrates how frontend components fetch data from backend APIs, and how changes are reflected in the database.
Nothing fancyâ€”just a clean, functional example of how things work under the hood.
